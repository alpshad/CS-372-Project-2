# SIMPLE - a CS 372 Project
## Introduction

**SIMPLE** is an interpreted, dynamically typed programming language for pseudocode-like programming. Its style and syntax are inspired by Ruby and Python. 

#### Running a SIMPLE .txt file.
It requires the Java JDK and JRE in order to run the Java Translator.
From the project root, run `javac *.java` followed by `java Translator <filename>.txt` in order to run a SIMPLE file in your terminal.

#### This language supports the following features:
`Functions`
`Variable Assignments`
`Integers`
`Strings and String Literals`
`Booleans and Boolean Expressions`
`Conditional Expressions`
`If-Statements`
`Addition, Subtraction, Division, Modulus, Multiplication, Exponents`
`While Loops and For Loops`
`Printing to output (terminal)`
`Command Line Arguments`

#### Project Extra Credit
Here is a list of the add-ons we have done:
- Complete support for Functions
- A full typing system (See the Wrapper class)
- Exponents (10 ^ 2 = 100, for example)
- A homemade ArrayList so as not to rely on Java (DynamicArray)
- An interpreted programming languageÂ rather than compiled 
- Single-line comments
- Xor

We hope you enjoy!
